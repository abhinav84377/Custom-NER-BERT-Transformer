# Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) with BERT-uncased

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the training and evaluation of a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model, fine-tuned from the pre-trained BERT-uncased model available in Hugging Face Transformers.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a specialized NER system tailored to recognize custom entity types, as defined in a unique dataset. We leverage the power of BERT-uncased to achieve state-of-the-art performance in identifying and classifying these custom entities.

## Contents

* **`custom_ner_bert_uncased.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook that includes the code for data loading, preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and evaluation.
* **`requirements.txt`**: A list of Python packages required to run the notebook.
* **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
* **`[dataset_description.md]`**: (Optional) A detailed description of your custom dataset.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, install the following dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
