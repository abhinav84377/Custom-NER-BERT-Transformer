# Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) with BERT-uncased

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the training and evaluation of a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model, fine-tuned from the pre-trained BERT-uncased model available in Hugging Face Transformers.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a specialized NER system tailored to recognize custom entity types, as defined in a unique dataset. We leverage the power of BERT-uncased to achieve state-of-the-art performance in identifying and classifying these custom entities.
